## Setting up our project

Having authorized and created your chatbot account within Twitch it's time to build our first chatbot.

First of all we have to install `@twitchfy/chatbot` package with our Node Package Manager.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash title='pnpm'
    pnpm add @twitchfy/chatbot
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash title='npm'
    npm i @twitchfy/chatbot
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Building the chatbot

Having set up our project it's time to start building our first chatbot.

For building the chatbot we have to create a new instance of the [ChatBot](/api/chatbot/classes/chatbot) class.

Here is a brief example of how to build a basic chatbot using webhooks or websocket connection.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="webhook/index.ts">

```ts showLineNumbers copy wrap
import { ChatBot, EventSubConnection } from "@twitchfy/chatbot";
import { RedisAdapter, WebhookConnection } from "@twitchfy/eventsub";
import { TokenAdapter } from "@twitchfy/helix";
import express from "express";

const appToken = new TokenAdapter({
  type: "app",
  token: "myAppToken",
});

//app tokens couldn't be refreshed within Twitch but for mocking that refresh the package regenerate the app token. App tokens are only used when setting the connection type to webhooks.

const userToken = new TokenAdapter({
  type: "code",
  token: "myUserToken",
  refreshToken: "myRefreshToken",
});

const chatbot = new ChatBot({
  clientId: 'your_client_id',
  clientSecret: 'your_client_secret'
  userToken,
  connectionType: EventSubConnection.Webhook,
  eventsub: {
    secret: "itsasecretshhhh",
    appToken,
    server: express(),
    baseURL: "https://eventsub-subscriptions.com",
    storage: { adapter: new RedisAdapter<WebhookConnection>() },
    startServer: true, //the package will start the server by default. Otherwise you will have to start it.
  },
  paths: {
    output: "dist", //the directory where your source code will be located (from current working directory). Using TypeScript it will be the output directory defined in the ts config file.
    commands: "commands" //the directory where your commands will be located (from output directory).
  },
});
```

To build up a chatbot using Webhooks we need to start a server and bound it with express.

The `secret` field is a kind of authorization against malicious attacks.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="websocket/index.ts">

```ts showLineNumbers copy wrap
import { ChatBot, EventSubConnection } from "@twitchfy/chatbot";
import { RedisAdapter, WebSocketConnection } from "@twitchfy/eventsub";
import { TokenAdapter } from "@twitchfy/helix";

const userToken = new TokenAdapter({
  type: "code",
  token: "myUserToken",
  refreshToken: "myRefreshToken",
});

const chatbot = new ChatBot({
  clientId: 'your_client_id',
  clientSecret: 'your_client_secret'
  userToken,
  connectionType: EventSubConnection.WebSocket,
  eventsub: {
    storage: { adapter: new RedisAdapter<WebSocketConnection>() },
  },
  paths: {
    output: "dist", //the directory where your source code will be located (from current working directory). Using TypeScript it will be the output directory defined in the ts config file.
    commands: "commands" //the directory where your commands will be located (from output directory).
  },
});
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
`Storage` option within eventsub options is used for saving the subscriptions and reloading them everytime you start of your application.

In the example above [RedisAdapter](/api/eventsub/classes/redisadapter) is used for storing the subscriptions within a Redis server. However you can customize your storage adapter by extending [StorageAdapter](/api/eventsub/classes/storageadapter) class. 

Additionally, there is a [MongoAdapter](/api/eventsub/classes/mongoadapter) class for storing subscriptions in MongoDB.
:::

:::note
Using TypeScript is highly recommended to declare twitchfy module for setting the default eventsub connection type as when creating events and commands you may specify the connection type always something which is not practical.

```ts showLineNumbers copy

import type { EventSubConnection } from '@twitchfy/chatbot';

declare module '@twitchfy/chatbot' {
  interface Options {
    connection: EventSubConnection.Webhook // or any other type of connection.
  }
}
```
:::
## Start your chatbot

Once you've created your chatbot, the next step is to get it online. Simply call the `start` method, which returns a Promise which will be resolved when the chatbot is fully operational.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="webhook/index.ts">

```ts showLineNumbers ins={33} copy wrap
import { ChatBot, EventSubConnection } from "@twitchfy/chatbot";
import { RedisAdapter, WebhookConnection } from "@twitchfy/eventsub";
import { TokenAdapter } from "@twitchfy/helix";
import express from "express";

const appToken = new TokenAdapter({
  type: "app",
  token: "myAppToken",
});

const userToken = new TokenAdapter({
  type: "code",
  token: "myUserToken",
  refreshToken: "myRefreshToken",
});

const chatbot = new ChatBot({
  clientId: 'your_client_id',
  clientSecret: 'your_client_secret'
  userToken,
  connectionType: EventSubConnection.Webhook,
  eventsub: {
    secret: "itsasecretshhhh",
    appToken,
    server: express(),
    baseURL: "https://eventsub-subscriptions.com",
    storage: { adapter: new RedisAdapter<WebhookConnection>() },
    startServer: true, 
  paths: {
    output: "dist",
    commands: 'commands'
  },
});

chatbot.start(3333).then(() => console.log('ChatBot is fully operational')) //as we set the startServer option into true we have to set the port which will be listened.
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="websocket/index.ts">

```ts showLineNumbers ins={23} copy wrap
import { ChatBot, EventSubConnection } from "@twitchfy/chatbot";
import { RedisAdapter, WebSocketConnection } from "@twitchfy/eventsub";
import { TokenAdapter } from "@twitchfy/helix";

const userToken = new TokenAdapter({
  type: "code",
  token: "myUserToken",
  refreshToken: "myRefreshToken",
});

const chatbot = new ChatBot({
  clientId: 'your_client_id',
  clientSecret: 'your_client_secret'
  userToken,
  connectionType: EventSubConnection.WebSocket,
  eventsub: {
    storage: { adapter: new RedisAdapter<WebSocketConnection>() },
  },
  paths: {
    output: "dist",
    commands: 'commands'
  },
});

chatbot.start().then(() => {
	console.log('ChatBot fully operational'))
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Joining Channels

Once you have set up your chatbot it's time to join to a broadcaster channel and listen to the broadcaster chatroom messages.

To join a channel you have to call `join` method in the chatbot [ChannelManager](/api/chatbot/classes/channelmanager) with the channel's id you want to join to. 

:::warning

It's recommended to join channels after the chatbot has fully started. If not it could led to anytype of errors.
:::

```ts showLineNumbers copy ins={29}

import { ChatBot, EventSubConnection } from "@twitchfy/chatbot";
import { RedisAdapter, WebSocketConnection } from "@twitchfy/eventsub";
import { TokenAdapter } from "@twitchfy/helix";

const userToken = new TokenAdapter({
  type: "code",
  token: "myUserToken",
  refreshToken: "myRefreshToken",
});

const chatbot = new ChatBot({
  clientId: 'your_client_id',
  clientSecret: 'your_client_secret'
  userToken,
  connectionType: EventSubConnection.WebSocket,
  eventsub: {
    storage: { adapter: new RedisAdapter<WebSocketConnection>() },
  },
  paths: {
    output: "dist",
    commands: 'commands'
  },
});

chatbot.start().then(() => {

  console.log('ChatBot fully operational')

  chatbot.channels.join('channelId').then(() => console.log('Joined'))

});
```

:::note

If you have an storage set into your chatbot's eventsub you won't need to join to the same channels everytime you start your application.

:::

:::note
To be able to join to channels you need either `channel:bot` scope from broadcaster or your chatbot to be a moderator of the channel you will join.
